# Annotator

## Features

* Display the annotation view (git blame) of the current file.
* Display the diff of a particular commit by selecting the annotation of a line.
* From the commit diff view, you can:
  * Open the annotation view of the file just before the commit, and trace back the history.
  * Open the diff of another file in the same commit.
* The vertical colour bar is coloured darker for older commits and lighter for more recent commits (or the other way around, depending on the colours you specified).
* Highlight the annotations with same commit hash when hovering over them.

Blame the current file and open the diff of a particular commit:

The annotation is opened in a separate tab; simply close that tab when you are done with it.

From the commit diff, annotate the contents of the left side of the diff view:

From the commit diff, open the diff of another file in the same commit:

![Open the diff of another file in the same commit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryu1kn/vscode-annotator/master/images/animations/open-diff-of-another-file.gif)

Annotation with different colour settings, etc.:

* **Reporting a bug:** Please include environment information (OS name/version, the editor version). Also consider providing screenshots (or even videos) where appropriate. They are often very very helpful!
